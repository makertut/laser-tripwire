# laser-tripwire

<h3>LED connection</h3>
LED attach to board
Resistor (220 ohm) one leg attach to LED long leg
The green wire attach to resistor's empty leg → Arduino D13
The black wire attach o LED short leg → Arduino GND

<h3>LDR Connection</h3>

LDR attach to board
Resistor (10k ohm) attach to LDR one leg
The Black wire attach to LDR other (empty) leg → Arduino Gnd
The Yellow wire attach to LDR and resistor same column → Arduino A0
The Red wire attach to resistor empty leg → Arduino 5V
